# Demo-ATS
This FastAPI backend serves as a versatile, branch-agnostic resume analyzer designed to handle both PDF and DOCX formats without persistent storage. It is architected to transition from a general structural evaluator into a high-fidelity ATS (Applicant Tracking System) scorer by leveraging memory-efficient parsing.
